Building a Flutter CRUD Application with MongoDB Atlas via Node.js API
I developed a Flutter application that performs full CRUD operations with a MongoDB database, using Node.js as middleware. The app features a user-friendly interface to display student information and allows users to add, edit, and delete records through secure API endpoints(Get,Post,Update,Delete). Key functionalities include data retrieval, submission, editing, and deletion, all managed by a Node.js server.
